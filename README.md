<h2>What's that?</h2>
<p>Harry Potter Characters was my first project with using API. As a huge fan of this universum I couldn't miss the oportunity to use a PotterAPI. It's simple page that shows you all significant people (and not only) of book series. You can search them by name and filter by membership. After clicking card the modal with all known facts will pop up. It's created with React and supported by PotterAPI.</p>
